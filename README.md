#AFNetworking-SeatMe

This is a maintained fork of the popular AFNetworking library. 

## Differences from AFNetworking

A few of the improvements and changes over upstream include:

  * **ARC** - we hit a bug with a retain cycle. (It was actually easier
    converting to arc than finding it.)
  * **Ability to override the cache storage policy** (this improves 
    support for NSURLCache and replacements like SDURLCache)
  * **iOS Multitasking support built in.**
  * **Allows configuration of the callback queue used to return asynchronous responses** 
    instead of hard coding to the `main_queue`. (The queue used by 
    default is the queue used to create the operation). 
  * **Better adherence to the DRY (don't repeat yourself) principle**. 
    Operation classes inherit background processing capability instead 
    of having the same code across all the operations classes.
  * **No reasonably unexpected behaviors or magic**. Instead prefer 
    explicit configuration. 
    * ```AFImageRequestOperation``` does not automagically scale your 
      images 2x if on retina devices on iOS by default. 
    * ~~The JSON library used to decode responses is configurable 
      and doesn't fallback under different OS versions.~~ (Integrated 
      with upstream's solution to this.)
  * **Typedef'd blocks** - Many block declarations used more than once 
    have a `typedef`
  * **UI/Networking separation** - Clearer separation of networking and 
    UI related code to make reusing code between Mac and iOS easier.
  * **More uniform across platforms** - Less ifdefs to change behavior 
    between Mac and iOS versions. 
    * AFXMLRequestOperation is spilt into two classes (one that returns 
      NSXMLParser that is available on both iOS and Mac OSX, and one that
      returns an NSXMLDocument for only Mac OSX).
    * AFImageRequestOperation doesn't #ifdef every function and instead 
      typedefs UIImage and NSImage internally to use a common type to improve 
      code readability and only breaks into #ifdefs where behavior is 
      different between the two image classes.
  * **Subclassable operations** - All Operation classes are completely 
    subclassable. All implementation details in set in the connivence methods 
    have been moved to the operation's initializers allowing you to subclass 
    them without issue. (as of 11/22/2011, upstream has started moving 
    in this direction)
  * **Doesn't override the behavior of the ```completionBlock``` property** 
    or remove access to it as a user. The design in this fork makes available a 
    finishedBlock that used as replacement to the success/failure blocks.


##Motivation for forking
AFNetworking is a wonderful library and one we use at SeatMe. In v0.5.0, we required a few modifications to prevent the NSOperations from calling back on the main_queue. Over time as we attempted to maintain these changes through newer releases of AFNetworking. However our code had diverged a bit. We are working to attempt to re-integrate our changes as best we can in a way that is acceptable to upstream, time permitting in our develop cycles. It's our hope to fully integrate upstream at some point. Until then, in the spirt of openness, we are making our changes available. 


#ORIGINAL README

AFNetworking is a delightful networking library for iOS and Mac OS X. It's built on top of [NSURLConnection](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSURLConnection_Class/Reference/Reference.html), [NSOperation](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/NSOperation_class/Reference/Reference.html), and other familiar Foundation technologies. It has a modular architecture with well-designed, feature-rich APIs that are a joy to use. For example, here's how easy it is to get JSON from a URL:

``` objective-c
NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:@"https://gowalla.com/users/mattt.json"];
NSURLRequest *request = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:url];
AFJSONRequestOperation *operation = [AFJSONRequestOperation JSONRequestOperationWithRequest:request success:^(NSURLRequest *request, NSHTTPURLResponse *response, id JSON) {
    NSLog(@"Name: %@ %@", [JSON valueForKeyPath:@"first_name"], [JSON valueForKeyPath:@"last_name"]);
} failure:nil];
[operation start];
```

Perhaps the most important feature of all, however, is the amazing community of developers who use and contribute to AFNetworking every day. AFNetworking powers some of the most popular and critically-acclaimed apps on the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. 

Choose AFNetworking for your next project, or migrate over your existing projectsâ€”you'll be happy you did!

## Example Usage

### XML Request

``` objective-c
NSURLRequest *request = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://api.flickr.com/services/rest/?method=flickr.groups.browse&api_key=b6300e17ad3c506e706cb0072175d047&cat_id=34427469792%40N01&format=rest"]];
AFXMLRequestOperation *operation = [AFXMLRequestOperation XMLParserRequestOperationWithRequest:request success:^(NSURLRequest *request, NSHTTPURLResponse *response, NSXMLParser *XMLParser) {
  XMLParser.delegate = self;
  [XMLParser parse];
} failure:nil];
[operation start];
```

### Image Request

``` objective-c
UIImageView *imageView = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0.0f, 0.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f)];
[imageView setImageWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://i.imgur.com/r4uwx.jpg"] placeholderImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"placeholder-avatar"]];
```

### API Client Request

``` objective-c
// AFGowallaAPIClient is a subclass of AFHTTPClient, which defines the base URL and default HTTP headers for NSURLRequests it creates
[[AFGowallaAPIClient sharedClient] getPath:@"/spots/9223" parameters:nil success:^(AFHTTPRequestOperation *operation, id responseObject) {
    NSLog(@"Name: %@", [responseObject valueForKeyPath:@"name"]);
    NSLog(@"Address: %@", [responseObject valueForKeyPath:@"address.street_address"]);
} failure:nil];
```

### File Upload with Progress Callback

``` objective-c
NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://api-base-url.com"];
AFHTTPClient *httpClient = [[AFHTTPClient alloc] initWithBaseURL:url];
NSData *imageData = UIImageJPEGRepresentation([UIImage imageNamed:@"avatar.jpg"], 0.5);
NSMutableURLRequest *request = [httpClient multipartFormRequestWithMethod:@"POST" path:@"/upload" parameters:nil constructingBodyWithBlock: ^(id <AFMultipartFormData>formData) {
    [formData appendPartWithFileData:imageData name:@"avatar" fileName:@"avatar.jpg" mimeType:@"image/jpeg"];
}];

AFHTTPRequestOperation *operation = [[[AFHTTPRequestOperation alloc] initWithRequest:request] autorelease];
[operation setUploadProgressBlock:^(NSInteger bytesWritten, NSInteger totalBytesWritten, NSInteger totalBytesExpectedToWrite) {
    NSLog(@"Sent %d of %d bytes", totalBytesWritten, totalBytesExpectedToWrite);
}];
[operation start];
```

### Streaming Request

``` objective-c
NSURLRequest *request = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://localhost:8080/encode"]];

AFHTTPRequestOperation *operation = [[[AFHTTPRequestOperation alloc] initWithRequest:request] autorelease];
operation.inputStream = [NSInputStream inputStreamWithFileAtPath:[[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"large-image" ofType:@"tiff"]];
operation.outputStream = [NSOutputStream outputStreamToMemory];
[operation start];
```

## Requirements

AFNetworking requires either [iOS 4.0](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#releasenotes/General/WhatsNewIniPhoneOS/Articles/iPhoneOS4.html%23//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009559-SW1) and above, or [Mac OS 10.6](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#releasenotes/MacOSX/WhatsNewInOSX/Articles/MacOSX10_6.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008898-SW7) and above.

AFNetworking uses [`NSJSONSerialization`](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Foundation/Reference/NSJSONSerialization_Class/Reference/Reference.html) if it is available. If your app targets a platform where this class is not available you can include one of the following JSON libraries to your project for AFNetworking to automatically detect and use.

* [JSONKit](https://github.com/johnezang/JSONKit)
* [SBJson](http://stig.github.com/json-framework/)
* [YAJL](http://lloyd.github.com/yajl/)

### ARC Support

AFNetworking will transition its codebase to ARC in a future release.

If you are including AFNetworking in a project that uses [Automatic Reference Counting (ARC)](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.html) enabled, you will need to set the `-fno-objc-arc` compiler flag on all of the AFNetworking source files. To do this in Xcode, go to your active target and select the "Build Phases" tab. In the "Compiler Flags" column, set `-fno-objc-arc` for each of the AFNetworking source files.
